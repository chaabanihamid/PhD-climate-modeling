# Mountains climate modeling in the context of climate change (PhD thesis)   
## First phase
The first part of the thesis aims to evaluate the ability of the LMDZ model to simulate the snow fraction, its interannual variability and its trend in the Moroccan mountains. Once the evaluation of the model is done, the objective is to produce long-term climatologies and projections. To do this, this first part has been divided into three phases:
### An in-depth and detailed climatology of snow cover in the Atlas Mountains over the period 1982-2018 using the ESA CCI snow cover fraction on ground daily and monthly original product and gap-filled product (using linear interpolation over a window of 10 time steps (one day)).

### Evaluation of the satellite product through in situ observations.

### scf evaluation from the LMDZ model. 

### Long term climatologies and projections
